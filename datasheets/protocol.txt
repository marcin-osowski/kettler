RS: reset
CM: command mode
EE: unknown, but it clearly changes state, error messages change

PD, PE, PT, PW, ST: all return the same thing, which is the current state of the machine
# heartRate cadence speed distanceInFunnyUnits destPower energy timeElapsed realPower
# 000 052 095 000 030 0001 00:12 030

PD: putdistance. The argument is the distance in 0.1km. The values are between 0 and999
PT: puttime. The argument is the time in seconds. The values are between 0 and 9959. First two digits describe minutes last two digits describe seconds. If the number of seconds is greater than 59 it will be reduced to 59
PP: putpower. The argument is power in watts. The values are between 25 and 400 in 5 steps. The values less than 25 are converted to 25. The values greater than 400 are converted to 400. The values are round down until the becomes multiple of 5
PW: putwatt. The argument is power in watts. The values are between 25 and 400 in 5 steps. The values less than 25 are converted to 25. The values greater than 400 are converted to 400. The values are round down until the becomes multiple of 5
PW nnn - set power to nnn watts


TR: returns time? How can it have time if it's not plugged in all the time?


ES1 - prints some information about the exercise

ID: device ID
KI: device model
